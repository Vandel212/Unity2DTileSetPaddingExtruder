Introduction
-----------------
Unity has an issue with 2D tilesets that can cause tearing on the screen if you don't have a 1 pixel padding around each square in the grid. Unfortunately not all tilesets come with the padding necessary, so you have to manually add them in which is tedious and the perfect job for a computer.

This will take in an image file, then add that padding for you.

Instructions
-----------------
0) Open your tile set image in a photo editor such as Paint.NET, then trim the outside of all blank space. so that the very top left of your tiles is in the very top left of the picture file. This step isn't 100% necessary, but I highly recommend it.

1) Once the program is opened, set the cell size for each square in your grid. The default is 16x16.

2) Click the "+" button and find your source file. This will set the output file to the same directory with "_padded" appended to the end of the file name.

3) Click the "Process" button. The program will run, and output the file.



****IMPORTANT****

This will overwrite the output file, so make sure you move it or rename it if you plan on using the same file name again.


That's it! Done! Enjoy! Goodbye!
